            	I've built Abyss to be the best <i>read later</i> app on your iPhone, iPad and Mac. Built from the ground up with privacy in mind, Abyss doesn't require you to log in on any external service. Everything happens on your device, and thanks to iCloud, your data is synced between all your devices and it's safely stored. Categorize your links by tags, add notes to remember why you saved them, search instantly on your entire library or download an offline copy of a website. Download it for <b>free</b> on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1507396839" target="_blank">App Store</a>.
